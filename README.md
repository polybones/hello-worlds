## hello-worlds

## Todo
- [ ] Add support for more languages (Clean, Lobster, etc.)
- [ ] Samples for esolangs
- [ ] Running code online / Web Frontend (?)
- [ ] Use alternative to Justfile (?)

## Why?
I wanted to create a simple project that could showcase the syntax of different languages because its something that interests me.

## Contributing
If you want to add another language feel free to make a PR and of course if you find any issues let me know.
